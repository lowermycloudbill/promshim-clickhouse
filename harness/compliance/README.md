# PromQL Compliance Harness

Runs the upstream Prometheus PromQL compliance suite against promshim and reference Prometheus, both backed by the same deterministic remote-write fixture.

A full two-pass run (prefer + native-only) finishes in ~15 seconds on a warm docker cache. Runs in the foreground; no minutes-long timeout needed.

## Layout

- `docker-compose.yml` — ClickHouse 26.3, Prometheus 3.5.2 (LTS, reference), promshim.
- `docker-compose.native-only.yml` — override that forces promshim into `native_lowering_mode=force_supported`; unsupported shapes fail explicitly instead of falling back to local evaluation. Used for pass #2.
- `prom-compliance/` — submodule; upstream `prometheus/compliance` tester.
- `test-promshim.yml` — tester config (endpoints, query window, tweaks).
- `scripts/run-compliance.sh` — runs one pass against whatever promshim is up; emits JSON reports under `../../harness/artifacts/compliance/` and reconciles against the allowlist (skipped in `--mode native`). When no artifact directory is provided, low-level helper scripts read/write `../../harness/artifacts/compliance/latest`.
- `scripts/patch-queries-for-prom3.py` — generates `patched-queries.yml` in the selected compliance artifact directory from the upstream corpus, dropping `should_fail: true` markers on entries Prom 3.x now accepts (UTF-8 label names). Upstream's corpus was last refreshed for Prom 2.26, so the tester would otherwise hard-abort at `comparer.go:95` the moment such a query returns success.
- `scripts/reconcile-expected.sh` — matches the report against `expected-failures.json`; any drift fails.
- `scripts/classify-failures.sh` — buckets failures by pattern (regex-matched).
- `scripts/native-gap-report.sh` — categorized breakdown of a native-mode report (diff failures, unsupported-root shapes, other errors). Informational only; never gates.
- `../../scripts/run-compliance.sh` — top-level runner: brings the stack up, seeds or verifies the deterministic fixture, runs pass #1 (prefer) and pass #2 (native-only), tears down.

## Running

Two-pass run from the repo root:

```
scripts/run-compliance.sh
```

That brings the stack up, writes reports to `../../harness/artifacts/compliance/<timestamp>/`, updates `../../harness/artifacts/compliance/latest` when possible, seeds the deterministic fixture into fresh Prometheus and ClickHouse volumes, verifies the expected fixture counts through both APIs, runs pass #1 against the default `prefer` mode (reconciled against `expected-failures.json`), recreates promshim with the `native-only` override, runs pass #2 (informational gap report), and tears the stack down.

Single pass from this directory (stack must already be up):

```
cd harness/compliance
docker compose up -d
scripts/run-compliance.sh --mode prefer --suffix prefer
scripts/classify-failures.sh ../../harness/artifacts/compliance/latest/compliance-report-prefer-<stamp>.json
```

The tester hits `29090` (Prom reference) and `29091` (promshim) with a pinned `end_time` inside the deterministic fixture window.

## Philosophy: gaps stay visible

The shim's native-SQL path is under active development. Any PromQL shape the shim doesn't yet handle is a **gap**, not an "expected failure." Gaps must stay visible so we keep pressure on ourselves to close them.

The allowlist (`expected-failures.json`) is reserved strictly for failures that are **not** shim gaps — failures driven by reference-side implementation details we can't reproduce exactly (e.g., Prometheus's TSDB iteration order leaking into `topk` tie-breaks). If you're tempted to add a shim-side limitation, don't; let it fail loudly until it's fixed.

## Instant-mode differential coverage

The upstream `prometheus/compliance` tester only issues `query_range` requests, so promshim's instant (`/api/v1/query`) fast paths were never differentially validated against reference Prometheus — that blind spot hid an instant-rate counter-reset bug (native `deltaSumTimestamp` contributes 0 on a reset, undercounting `rate(...[1h])` when a counter resets inside the window).

Each pass now also runs `cmd/promshim-instant-compliance` over `instant-queries.yml`: a curated instant corpus (the counter/rate/increase family plus a representative gauge/aggregation/range-function spread) evaluated at the same pinned `end_time` on both targets and compared within Prometheus's default float tolerance. It gates in `prefer` mode (a divergence is a real bug, never allowlisted) and is informational in `native` mode, mirroring the range flow. Reports land beside the range reports as `compliance-report-instant-{prefer,native}-<stamp>.json`.

To keep the instant gate honest, `demo_memory_usage_bytes % 1.2345` is intentionally excluded from `instant-queries.yml` — its sub-1e-6 ClickHouse-vs-Go modulo drift is an accepted primitive difference already covered by the range suite's `native-modulo-small-float-drift` tolerance.

`instant-queries.yml` also has a `known_divergences` section: queries with a pre-existing, separately-tracked reference-vs-shim divergence that is out of scope for the change that added the coverage. These are still evaluated and reported on every run (so the divergence stays visible and any change surfaces) but do not gate on the divergence itself. This is not `expected-failures.json` and must never hide an in-scope shim bug — every entry carries a `note` pointing at the tracked defect. It currently holds the `rate(...offset...)` / `increase(...offset...)` extrapolation-anchoring bug (the factor is anchored at the raw eval time instead of eval-time-minus-offset, reading ~8% low; affects both instant and range modes), surfaced by this instant coverage and tracked separately.

The section cannot silently rot: in gate mode a `known_divergences` entry that **stops** diverging (now matches reference) is flagged `[KNOWN:STALE]` and **fails the gate**. A stale entry is a claim of a tracked divergence that no longer exists, so it must be deleted (or promoted to a gating `queries:` entry now that it passes) — the gate forces that mechanically rather than letting the allowlist accumulate dead entries. An entry that still diverges stays reported and non-gating.

## Two passes

Each full run does two passes against the same frozen fixture:

1. **`prefer` mode (gated)** — the default runtime lowering mode. The shim lowers whatever it can to native SQL and falls back to local evaluation for everything else. Reconciled against `expected-failures.json`; any unexpected failure exits non-zero.
2. **`native-only` mode (informational)** — `PROM_SHIM_NATIVE_LOWERING_MODE=force_supported`. Unsupported shapes return an explicit error instead of falling back. Produces a categorized gap inventory via `native-gap-report.sh`. Never gates — the numbers are the work queue, and they trend down as native lowering coverage grows.

## Allowlist (`expected-failures.json`)

One tolerance is currently accepted for the deterministic compliance fixture: `native-modulo-small-float-drift` on `demo_memory_usage_bytes % 1.2345`.

ClickHouse native modulo uses `x - trunc(x / y) * y` instead of Go/Prometheus `math.Mod`, which can cause tiny float drift on large operands. The tolerance is query-specific and bounded to an absolute `1e-6`; labels and timestamps must still match exactly.

The allowlist remains intentionally available for narrow cases where exact Prometheus behavior depends on reference-side storage internals or an immaterial primitive-level difference. Entries must be exact and specific; stale allowlist entries fail reconciliation so a missing fixture cannot make CI pass vacuously.

## Known gaps (visible; not allowlisted)

These surface as failures every run. They're tracked openly here, not in `expected-failures.json`:

### UTF-8 label-name destinations in `label_replace` / `label_join`

- `label_replace(demo_num_cpus, "~invalid", "", "src", "(.*)")`
- `label_join(demo_num_cpus, "~invalid", "-", "instance")`

Under Prom 2.x both errored (invalid label name). Prom 3.x relaxed label names to full UTF-8, so both now succeed in the reference. The shim still rejects `~invalid` with `bad_data: invalid destination label name`. Upstream's `should_fail: true` markers reflect Prom 2.x; `patch-queries-for-prom3.py` strips them so the tester doesn't hard-abort at `comparer.go:95`. The resulting unexpected-failure rows are real — the shim needs Prom 3.x UTF-8 label-name support. Will close when that lands.

### Native-mode coverage gaps

Pass #2 catches everything the native-SQL path doesn't yet cover. Run `scripts/native-gap-report.sh` against the latest native-mode report for a categorized view:

- `diff_failure` — native lowered the query but returned wrong values. These are **real native-SQL correctness bugs**.
- `unsupported_root` — planner refused to lower (root-plan rejection). Missing coverage.
- `other` — bad_data, timeouts, etc.

Each number should trend down over time. None are allowlistable.

## Fixture

The top-level runner seeds a deterministic `demo_*` fixture through remote write into both reference Prometheus and ClickHouse when fresh volumes are empty. The seed intentionally includes large varied gauges, exact gauge ties, counter resets, a sparse metric that disappears before the evaluation timestamp, and histogram buckets matching the old scraped fixture's bucket/cardinality shape. It then verifies, at the pinned `end_time` in `test-promshim.yml`, that both APIs expose the expected fixture marker, core series counts, sparse-series absence, reset count, and tie coverage before any compliance query runs.

If old scraped data or a partially seeded fixture is present, the runner fails before the compliance pass and asks you to reset the compliance volumes:

```bash
cd harness/compliance
docker compose down -v
```

This prevents empty or stale fixtures from producing vacuous green CI runs.
